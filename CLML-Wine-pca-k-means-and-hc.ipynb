    "Anyone wishing to run this notebook or the code contained there in must take note of the following:\n",
    "  - This tutorial relies on the github version of [`CLML` https://github.com/mmaul/clml.git](https://github.com/mmaul/clml.git) or a quicklist-dist `CLML`> than 20150805 \n",
    "  - The plotting portion of this code requires the system [`clml.extras` https://github.com/mmaul/clml.extras.git](https://github.com/mmaul/clml.extras.git) which is not currently in quicklisp.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "This article will discuss two clustering techniques, k-means and Hierarchical Clustering.\n",
    "Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique, with the goa to group to samples into a given number of partitions.\n",
    "Clustering uses uses the similarity between examples and groups examples based of their mutual similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wine\n",
    "\n",
    "Wine such a multideminensional beverage. A feast for the senses, taste, smell even for the eyes. It also pairs well with statistical analysis techniques and even Lisp. What does wine and statistical analysis have to do with one another you may ask. Well the Wine dataset at it the 'goto' dataset used in just about every introduction cluster analysis. The Wine dataset is a chemical analysis of three types of wines wines grown in a region of Italy. The dataset contains an analysis of 178 samples, with 13 results of chemical assays for each sample. It is small enough yet contains enough complexity to be interesting. The real value is that the dataset already contains the classification, so the lazy (er I mean pragmitic) presenters don't have to justify the classification, they only have to compare the results agains the esisting classifications. While were on the subject of wine if you find yourself in eastern Washington, I highly recommend stopping by the [Parisisos del Sol](www.paradisosdelsol.com) winery, good wine, down to earth atmosphere and a really interesting and knowledgeable propriter. \n",

    "6. Steps 4 and 5 are repeated until stability is achived.\n",
    "\n",

    "So for testing or teaching you will want to set a fixed `:random-state` which will allow you have repeatable results (It influnces the choice of the seed clusters). \n",

    "    - standardization:t | nil, whether to standardize the inputs\n",
    "    - max-iteration:  maximum number of iterations of one trial (default 1000)\n",
    "    - num-of-trials:  number of trials, every trial changes the initial position of the clusters. (Default 10)\n",
    "    - random-state:   (for testing), specify the random-state of the random number generator\n",

    "A nice concise description of the processs of agglomerative clustering from [improvedoutcomes.com/](http://www.improvedoutcomes.com/docs/WebSiteDocs/Clustering/Agglomerative_Hierarchical_Clustering_Overview.htm) is as follows:\n",
    "  - Assign each object to a separate cluster.\n",
    "  - Evaluate all pair-wise distances between clusters (distance metrics are described in Distance Metrics Overview).\n",
    "  - Construct a distance matrix using the distance values.\n",
    "  - Look for the pair of clusters with the shortest distance.\n",
    "  - Remove the pair from the matrix and merge them.\n",
    "  - Evaluate all distances from this new cluster to all other clusters, and update the matrix.\n",
    "  - Repeat until the distance matrix is reduced to a single element.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `distance-matrix`takes an optional argument `:distance-fn` which specifices the distance function used in the distance computations. The distance functions avalable are:\n",
    "  - ecludian (Default)\n",
    "  - manhattan\n",
    "  - pearson\n",
    "  - cosine\n",
    "  - tanimoto\n",
    "  - caberra\n",
    "\n",
    "The `cophonetic-matric` function evaluates the distance matric and returns the merge and cophonetic matrix. The `cophonetic-matrix` take a optional `:method` parameter to specify the method used to evaulate the distance matrix. The evaluation methods are as follows.\n",

    "  - `hc-complete`\n",
